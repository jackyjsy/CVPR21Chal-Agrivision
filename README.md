# CVPR21Chal-Agrivision
This repo contains the code to reproduce our results in CVPR21 Challenge on Agriculture-Vision.

We used ensemble results from two models to be our final submitted results.

The first model is modified MSCG-Net, please see [README.md](MSCG-Net/README.md) to train and test the model.


# MSCG-Net for Semantic Segmentation
## Introduce
This repository contains code modified from MSCG-Net models (MSCG-Net-50 and MSCG-Net-101) for semantic segmentation in [Agriculture-Vision Challenge and Workshop](https://www.agriculture-vision.com/agriculture-vision-2021/prize-challenge-2021) (CVPR 2021). Original readme file can be found [here](MSCGNET-README.MD)

## Dataset prepare

1. change DATASET_ROOT to your dataset path in ./data/AgricultureVision/pre_process.py
```
DATASET_ROOT = '/your/path/to/Agriculture-Vision'
```

2. keep the dataset structure as the same with the official structure shown as below
```
Agriculture-Vision
|-- train
|   |-- masks
|   |-- labels
|   |-- boundaries
|   |-- images
|   |   |-- nir
|   |   |-- rgb
|-- val
|   |-- masks
|   |-- labels
|   |-- boundaries
|   |-- images
|   |   |-- nir
|   |   |-- rgb
|-- test
|   |-- boundaries
|   |-- images
|   |   |-- nir
|   |   |-- rgb
|   |-- masks
```

## Train with all available GPUs

```
python train_R101.py
```

## Test

```
python test_submission.py
```

#### Trained weights for R101 (save to ./ckpt/R101_baseline before run test_submission)
